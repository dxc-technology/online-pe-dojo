## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online Product Engineering Dojo**.

Thank you for making time to take this course. We hope the investment of your time is rewarded with Product Engineering learnings and insights. We further hope that you can apply these learnings in your work and in your team's work.

## Online Product Engineering Dojo

This course includes **5** modules:

* Welcome

* Introduction to Product Engineering

* Design Thinking

* Getting Started

* Assessment

## Katacoda environment

The modules make use of Katacoda environments. Those are ephemeral environments which are created just for you, on the fly.

**Note:** Katacoda environments will time out after one hour. The modules have been designed with that limitation in mind. You should aim to complete each module in a single sitting.

So, go grab a cup of your favorite ☕️ or 🍵. Resist the temptation to multi-task, turn off all electronic devices 📴 other than the device you are taking this course on, of course.

Let's get started on Product Engineering!

## Welcome module

In this Welcome module, we will get you started by introducing you to the scenario and the cast of characters. Once you are all set, you can complete the other modules in the  **Online Product Engineering Dojo** at your own pace.

This course is set in the Pet Clinic 🐱🐶🐹🐯🐰🐸🏥 - Multiverse 💥.

We will begin by introducing Universal Imports the group of companies led by the **C**harlie the CEO of [Pet Clinic](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/modules/) fame and our troupe of characters.
