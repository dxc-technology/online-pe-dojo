We trust having completed this module that you have a better understanding of the importance of the need to improve your teams' Product Engineering practices and how you can start to improve your teams' Product Engineering practices.

If that is the case then there is an optional challenge awaiting you.

The challenge is to set some time aside on your teams' calendar to review your approach to Product Engineering, to document that approach and to compare with the Universal Imports Group's recommended Product Engineering practices.

We wish you well with the challenge, should you decide to accept it. Hopefully it will help you identify and, in time, make significant improvements in the Product Engineering practices applied in your teams' applications and services. 💹 ♻️🕙💯 ✔️
