## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online Product Engineering Dojo** Getting Started module.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the **Getting Started** module is to help you to start assessing, understanding and improving your development team's Product Engineering practices.

Building and fostering product-oriented engineering teams isnâ€™t easy, as the saying goes _"if it was everyone would be doing it"_.

Product-oriented engineering teams should not be considered as feature factories. They are capable of and ultimately responsible for so much more than just cutting code.

They need to be

- Empowered stakeholders and custodians of all facets of the product experience.

- Aware of the value proposition of and the impact of the product they are building.

- In constant contact with, and thus in tune with the needs of the customers.

- Focused on continuous improvement and the elimination of waste in all phases of the product development and product lifecycle.

- Plugged into the ideation and design process.

- Committed to the cultural pivot needed to move an organization from a project to a product mindset.
