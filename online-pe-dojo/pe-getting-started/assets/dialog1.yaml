    As discussed, we need to prepare a plan of action for improving the Product Engineering Practices in the group.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Let's start by ensuring we know who our customers are and by understanding the challenge facing us.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
   Anyone care to make a start on that?
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Our Customers are the application development teams across the group.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Our objective is to improve Product Engineering Practices across the group.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Good, you are aware of and also Empathize with your customers.
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    I would Define our mission as Improving the Product Engineering Practices across the group.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Perfect Brenda, any Ideas as to how we might go about doing that?
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    Provide a template that teams across the group could use to introduce Product Engineering.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Agree, we have already defined a Product Engineering manifesto for the group.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Whilst it is not perfect it will help teams make the cultural pivot needed.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    We could also provide teams with a series of recommended steps to introduce Product Engineering.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    That would help them make provisions in their backlog for the introduction of Product Engineering.
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    For a Prototype we could select a development team and have them apply and Test the collateral.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    But how would that scale?
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    We don't have the bandwidth as a team to run workshops for all the teams that would need them.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    As my old college professor used to say, we need to teach teams "How to fish."
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    That is, we could Productize the process of how to introduce Product Engineering.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    I like where you are going with this.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    To help us scale we could create an interactive Katacoda course providing an Overview of Product Engineering.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    A course that would encapsulate the content we would share with the teams during F2F workshops.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Excellent, that indeed would help us scale to the required level and to the required cadence.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Sounds like a plan, but we do have our work cut out for us.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    OK, we better get started then. After all only the dude abides, the rest of us got to hustle.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Oh man, we might as well go bowling then.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    "*chuckles*"
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Before we wrap up this session, can we prepare a few questions so we can ask them to [student]?
---
speaking: Brenda
text: >
    Sure, I will get working on those and will share them when they are ready.
