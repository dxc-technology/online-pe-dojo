   When documenting the Product Engineering Lifecycle we identified the need to improve our practices in two phases.

    The Ideation & Conceptualization and Architecture & Prototyping phases.

    Miyagi, you mentioned that companies you have worked with use Design Thinking for that very purpose.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Yes. Companies are realizing that creating a design-driven business allows them to better engage with their customers.
---
speaking: Paulo

    What do you mean by a design-driven business?
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    A business which applies a design model underpinned by three key elements.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    1. A strong focus on understanding their customers and their customers' needs.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    2. A sense of organizational empathy with customers.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    3. The application of design & technology in support of business strategy.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    What is the primary benefit which ensues from applying that design model?
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    The main benefit is that the design process becomes a bridge which enables the organization to turn creative ideas into innovative products which meet the needs of the market.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Design Thinking can be used to link design and business outcomes.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Which is what we want to do here.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Will you provide an overview of Design Thinking for the team?
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Gladly.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Great. Adriana as we discuss Design Thinking will you prepare a couple of questions for [student] on the topic?
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Will do. We all know how [student] likes a good question or two.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Questions which they can Empathize with, Define the scope of, Ideate over
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
     Prototype answers for and Test their understanding of Design Thinking.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    See what I did there?
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Unfortunately yes, and I expect [student] will as well.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Still it is good to see that InGen has some prior exposure to Design Thinking.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Yes we have been using it for some time in support of MVA - minimum viable architecture.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    MVA allows us to put viable products in the hands of users as quickly as possible and at the lowest cost possible.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    We then get feedback from the users on how product is used.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Which in turn enables us to learn how to improve the product.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    I am sure that MVA presents unique challenges in the space exploration industry.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    However we are not all rocket scientists.
---
speaking: Adriana
text: >
    Another rocket scientist joke! Just what I needed.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Bad jokes aside, Design Thinking looks like it will meet our needs.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Hearing that it is being used in support of MVA in InGen is great.
---
speaking: Pennyworth
text: >
    Miyagi, let us know when you are ready with the overview of Design Thinking.
---
speaking: Miyagi
text: >
    Will do.
