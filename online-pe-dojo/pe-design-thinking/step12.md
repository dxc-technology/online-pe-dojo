Hopefully after this introduction to Design Thinking you are ready to:

- Empathize

- Define

- Ideate

- Prototype

- Test

and that you realize that Design Thinking:

- Is for everyone.

- Is a user-centered approach to problem solving.

- Allows designers and teams to apply their collective skills to large challenging problems.

- Is a step-by-step process with amplified feedback loops repeated over multiple iterations.

- Represents a fundamental change, with ensuing challenges and opportunities for organizations.

If that is the case, then you are in luck as there is an optional challenge awaiting you.

The challenge is to review the Universal Imports groups' Product Engineering lifecycle, shown below, with your team:

Also discuss where and how you might apply Design Thinking:

in support of **all** phases of the Product Engineering lifecycle.

We wish you well with the challenge.
